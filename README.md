healthcare plan for their needs through a series of questions.

## Team Members

- Justin Finn: Responsible for database and backend development.
- Gabriel Speer: Responsible for front-end development. 
- Jesse Warren: Responsible for backend and server development.

Relief is built off of a series of applications and languages to help form the
website. For the front end we are using replit to help demonstrate the UI look and
functionality and in the backend we are using Visual Studio Code with a multitude of 
different plugins like: Node.js, mysql2, dotenv. 

The usage of this website:
- You can login or set up a new account if you don't have one already
- The intended purpose of this website is for it to ask you a series of questions
  that will be saved to the database. It'll then return to you a
  potential useful health-care plan designed for your personal use.
